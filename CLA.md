# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

**HeytingLean Project**

---

## Why a CLA?

This project uses **dual licensing** (AGPL-3.0 + Commercial). To maintain this model and allow commercial licensing of the complete codebase, we need permission from contributors to include their contributions under both licenses.

This CLA grants the HeytingLean Project the rights needed to:
1. Distribute your contributions under AGPL-3.0
2. Include your contributions in commercially licensed versions
3. Relicense if necessary for project sustainability
