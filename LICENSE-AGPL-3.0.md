## Section 13: Remote Network Interaction

The defining feature of AGPL-3.0 (vs GPL-3.0):

> Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
> Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting
> with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such
> interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your
> version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network
> server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of
> facilitating copying of software.

**In plain language:** If you modify this software and run it as a web service (SaaS), you must make your modified source code available to users of that service.

If you use this software under AGPL-3.0:

1. **Keep copyright notices** intact in all copies
2. **Include this license** with any distribution
3. **Provide source code** to anyone who receives the software
4. **For network services:** Provide a link to source code (e.g., "Powered by HeytingLean - [Source Code]")
5. **Document modifications** you make
6. **License derivatives** under AGPL-3.0

## Alternative: Commercial License
