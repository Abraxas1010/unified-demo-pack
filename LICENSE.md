# HeytingLean Unified Demo Pack — Licensing

**Copyright (c) 2026 HeytingLean Project. All rights reserved.**

This software is available under a **dual licensing model**, allowing you to choose the license that best fits your needs.

---

## Option 1: Open Source License (AGPL-3.0)

For **open source projects**, **academic research**, **personal use**, and **evaluation**, this software is available under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0** (AGPL-3.0).

See [LICENSE-AGPL-3.0.md](LICENSE-AGPL-3.0.md) for the full license text.

### What this means:

✅ **You CAN:**
- Use, study, and modify the software freely
- Distribute copies of the software
- Use in academic research and publications
- Use in open source projects (under AGPL-3.0 compatible licenses)

⚠️ **You MUST:**
- Release any derivative works under AGPL-3.0
- Provide source code to users who interact with the software over a network (the "network copyleft" provision)

## Option 2: Commercial License

For **proprietary use**, **commercial products**, **SaaS offerings**, or any use case where AGPL-3.0 obligations are not suitable, a **Commercial License** is available.

See [LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md](LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md) for terms and contact information.

### Commercial License Benefits:

- ✅ Use in proprietary products without open-sourcing your code
- ✅ No copyleft obligations for derivative works
- ✅ No network disclosure requirements for SaaS use
- ✅ Priority support options available
- ✅ Indemnification options available
- ✅ Custom terms negotiable for enterprise deployments

### Pricing

Commercial licenses are priced based on:
- Deployment scale (individual, team, enterprise)

## Why Dual Licensing?

Formal verification of cryptography requires significant expertise and effort. The dual licensing model allows us to:

1. **Keep the work open and auditable** — Critical for cryptographic trust. Security researchers, academics, and the open source community can inspect, verify, and build upon our proofs.

2. **Enable broad academic adoption** — Universities and researchers can use and extend this work freely under AGPL-3.0.

3. **Support continued development** — Commercial licensing provides resources for ongoing maintenance, new features, and security updates.

4. **Serve enterprise needs** — Organizations requiring proprietary use or SaaS deployment have a clear, legal path forward.
