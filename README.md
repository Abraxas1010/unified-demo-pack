## Bridging Quantum Foundations and Post-Quantum Security

This repository represents a novel approach to formal verification: unifying **quantum contextuality theory** with **post-quantum cryptographic primitives** in a single, machine-checked framework. Rather than treating these as separate domains, we demonstrate that the mathematical structures underlying quantum non-classicality and lattice-based cryptography share deep connections through **Heyting algebras** and **sheaf-theoretic methods**.

### Why This Matters

**The Quantum-Classical Boundary**: Quantum contextuality—the impossibility of assigning pre-existing values to quantum observables consistently across all measurement contexts—is one of the sharpest demarcations between quantum and classical physics. The Kochen-Specker theorem and Bell inequalities are famous examples. But contextuality isn't just physics; it's a **logical structure** that can be formalized and machine-verified.

**Post-Quantum Cryptography**: As quantum computers threaten RSA and elliptic curve cryptography, lattice-based schemes (MLWE, SIS, Ring-LWE) offer the most promising alternatives. These rely on the hardness of problems in high-dimensional lattices—mathematical structures that, surprisingly, connect to the same algebraic frameworks used in quantum foundations.

**The Bridge**: This project demonstrates that:
- Contextuality witnesses can be formalized as **obstructions to global sections** in a sheaf-theoretic setting
- The same Heyting algebra structures that capture intuitionistic logic also describe **homomorphic encryption** semantics
- Zero-knowledge proofs over lattice problems share structural properties with quantum non-locality arguments

By proving these connections in Lean 4 with Mathlib, we don't just claim they exist—we provide **machine-checkable evidence**.

## What's Inside

### 1. Contextuality Witnesses

We provide two complementary contextuality witnesses, each formally verified:

#### Triangle Model (Possibilistic)

A three-context measurement scenario proving that no global assignment of outcomes exists:

```
Contexts: C_ab, C_bc, C_ac (three overlapping measurement settings)
Supports:
  - AB: outcomes where a = b
  - BC: outcomes where b = c
  - AC: outcomes where a ≠ c

Theorem: triangle_no_global — no global section exists
```

Each support has exactly 2 elements (proved via explicit bijections), and the incompatibility of AC with AB∩BC demonstrates contextuality.

#### Mermin-Peres Magic Square (Quantum-Realizable)

The Mermin-Peres magic square is a 3x3 grid of two-qubit observables where:
- Each row product = +I (identity)
- Each column product = +I... except column 3 = -I

```lean
theorem no_assignment : ¬∃ (f : Fin 3 → Fin 3 → Int),
  (∀ i j, f i j = 1 ∨ f i j = -1) ∧
  (∀ i, f i 0 * f i 1 * f i 2 = 1) ∧
  (∀ j, f 0 j * f 1 j * f 2 j = if j = 2 then -1 else 1)
```

This is grounded in actual quantum mechanics via explicit Pauli matrix constructions in `HeytingLean.Quantum.Contextuality.MerminPeresRealization`, proving the operator identities that make this a physically realizable witness.

### 2. Valuation Framework (Finite Cardinalities)

We avoid unmeasurable claims about entropy or probability and instead work with **finite support cardinalities**—concrete, computable invariants:

| Context | Support Size | Proof |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| AB | 2 | `supportAB_card` |
| BC | 2 | `supportBC_card` |
| AC | 2 | `ContextualityAC.lean` |

### 3. Physical Process Layer (Quantum States & Channels)

The contextuality witnesses are grounded in a rigorous physical process formalization:

```lean
-- Density operators (positive semidefinite, trace 1)
structure Density (n : ℕ) where
  mat : Mat n
  psd : PosSemidef mat
  tr_one : Matrix.trace mat = 1

-- Quantum channels via Kraus representation
structure KrausChannel (n m : ℕ) where
  ops : List (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin m) ℂ)
  complete : ∑ K in ops, Kᴴ * K = 1
```

Key verified properties:
- `trace_map`: Channels preserve trace
- `isHermitian_map`: Channels preserve Hermiticity
- `posSemidef_map`: Channels preserve positive semidefiniteness

This provides the mathematical foundation for treating contextuality as a property of *physical processes*, not just abstract combinatorics.

### 4. FHE Hook (Homomorphic Encryption)

A spec-level formalization of noise-aware homomorphic addition over MLWE-shaped ciphertexts:

```lean
theorem homAdd_correct :
  EncRel P β₁ ct₁ m₁ → EncRel P β₂ ct₂ m₂ →
  EncRel P (β₁ + β₂) (addCt ct₁ ct₂) (m₁ + m₂)
```

This captures the essential correctness property: homomorphic operations preserve the message while noise accumulates predictably.

### 5. ZK Hook (SIS Proof of Knowledge)

A boolean verifier for Short Integer Solution (SIS) proofs of knowledge:

```lean
theorem sisVerify_sound : sisVerify params x w = true → SISInstance params x
```

This provides the type-level guarantee that passing verification implies a valid SIS witness exists.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/Abraxas1010/unified-demo-pack.git
cd unified-demo-pack
make bootstrap   # installs elan if needed; fetches mathlib; builds

# Run verification
make run-quick   # Lean-only: contextuality + valuation + FHE/ZK hooks
```

### Output (JSON Contract)

```json

    ]
  },
  "fhe": { "hom_add_demo": true },

### Full Mode (with PQC Corpora Verification)

```bash
make run-full    # runs ACVP/KAT verification, sets sentinel, includes evidence hash
```

In full mode, `pqc.verified` becomes `true` and includes a hardened evidence hash (SHA256 over verification scripts and stdout).

## The Bigger Picture

This project is part of a larger research program exploring the **HeytingLean** framework—using Heyting algebras and topos-theoretic methods to unify:

- **Quantum foundations** (contextuality, non-locality, measurement)
- **Cryptographic primitives** (FHE, ZK, lattice problems)
- **Intuitionistic logic** (constructive proofs, type theory)
- **Category theory** (sheaves, sites, nuclei)

The key insight is that **contextuality is not just a quantum phenomenon**—it's a structural feature that appears whenever local consistency doesn't imply global consistency. This same pattern appears in:

- Distributed systems (eventual consistency vs. strong consistency)
- Cryptographic protocols (local simulation vs. global soundness)
- Database theory (view update problem)
- Modal logic (Kripke semantics with non-trivial accessibility)

By formalizing these connections in a proof assistant, we create **reusable infrastructure** for verified reasoning across domains.
